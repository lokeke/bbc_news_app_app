Hello Guys,

I have read the Requirments and ready to begin with this first/second commit.

I have had to make the Repository Public in the first instance to allow me Commit and PUSH to it from Android Studio as I develop and implement the app, but will change access visibility rights to Private and soon as I'm happy with the native app

As suggested you I plan to finish in two evenings and not go "Ape" or "Nuts" with implementation and coding just as you suggested, Instead I'll just give you Signposts and Pointers of to what I would have liked to do next.

So as the very first Sign Post, I was going to implement the news data article in Firebase, creating a new table in our alreadyexisting Central EU Emissions Database (CEED) that I used to implement the "Emissions Trading Network : EU-ETS", but as a Read the Requirements, I will use the JSON data for API our backend engineer on the Team has already implemented, to save from 're-inventing the Wheel'.

Also I wanted you to access this Repo through www.ese-edet.eu/links, by clicking this link (www.ese-edet.eu/links) and then clicking Link #19 : "itet_app.Other.Modules.bbcnewsapp", to showcase and give you a flavour of the first of the two Big projects I've been working on (FYI). You can do that now anyway to have a look if you are curious.

But instead, when I am ready to submit to native news app for evaluation I will simply make the Repo private and invite you as a contributor.

the first big project on my Portfolio is called "itet the 'Emissions Trading Network' : for the EU-ETS" also known as ("the ETNET"), this is a massive/behemouth project that took me a few years to implement in the .NET Framework, I am the Founder and Lead Software Engineer in ESE, S.C.I. LTD, a carbon trading software company and the ETNET is it's prime product offering to the Subscribers and Members of the Emissions Trading Network.

Members and Subcribers to the Emissions Trading Network are all the Participant of a Specific Emissions Trading Scheme, (in this instance the European Union Emissions Trading Shceme, (EU-ETS) I invite you to find out more information about the EU-ETS by googling "EU-ETS" and watching the Youtube video explaining it.

This is carbon-trading software product facilitates carbon-emissions trading betweeen members of the European-Union Emissions Trading Scheme : (https://ec.europa.eu/clima/eu-action/eu-emissions-trading-system-eu-ets_en)

itet connects together all Participants of a Particular Emissions Trading Scheme into a single fast digital network and electronic framework for executing carbon trades among members using EUA Retail Spot Contracts, it also connects into the mix the Regulator, the Verifier, the Certifier, the Exchange Broker and Central European Authority for broader technological capabilities, to make Carbon-trading easy-er, Europe.

I invite you to use the www.ese-edet.eu/links to explore more about the technology we call the Emissions Trading Network for the EU-ETS.


The second Big Project in my Portfolio is called Calorie Countdown app, Weight Loss Software for Mobiles, written in both Android and iOS, I invite you explore more about the Mobile app currently Published on Google Play by clicking the link www.facebook.com/weightlossapp


The third Big Project in my Portfolio is the itet app, which is an extension/module of the Emissions Trading Network targeted towards the The Public, designed to give them and accessiblity insight and window into Carbon-emissions trading.


So those are my 3 Big Portfolio Projects just to give you some background into myself.

Now back to the native news app!!

End of Commit #2
